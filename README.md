# Electric_Vehicle_Population
• In this project, I Analyzed the dataset registered through the Washington State Department of Licensing (DOL) by writing SQL queries to answer interesting questions about the electric vehicle population from 1997 to 2023. Additionally, I created a Power BI dashboard to visualize these insights. The dataset is from Data.gov, provided by the State of Washington, and consists of 159,463 records.

#### From the analysis, i found interesting questions like
1. How many vehicles are registered through the Washington State Department of Licensing (DOL) from 1997 to 2023?
2. What is the population of Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) electric vehicles?
3. Which vehicle model has the highest population?
4. Which city has the highest vehicle population?
5. What is the vehicle population by vehicle model year from 1997 to 2023?

• The dataset consists of details such as County, City, State, Postal code, Vehicle Model year, Vehicle Brand, Vehicle Model, Electric Vehicle Type, Electric Range, and more.
